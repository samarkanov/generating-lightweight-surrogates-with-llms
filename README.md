High-fidelity simulations are powerful but slow. Traditionally, creating faster "surrogate" models is a manual, multi-step process. In this post, I demonstrate how to **automate the entire surrogate construction workflow** by using an LLM agent. By interfacing with a Simulink model via an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server, the agent autonomously runs simulations, analyzes "golden data," and implements a data-driven interpolation algorithm to create a lightweight, high-speed model.
